    AA, CC     Two initial guesses at the desired root
    Epsilon       Error Tolerance
    Func          Pointer to function whose root is desired
    Max           Maximum number of iterations
    Answer      Best estimate obtained for desired root
    Verbose     Boolean indicator of whether or not to print results of each iteration

Initialize:
    X1 = AA
    X2 = CC
    X3 = (X1 + X2) / 2.0
    Y1 = Func( X1 )
    Y2 = Func( X2 )
    Y3 = Func( X3 )
    C1 = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1)
Begin Iterations:

    For i = 1 to Max
            C2 = (Y3 - Y2) / (X3 - X2)
            D = (C2 - C1) / ( X3 - X1)
            S = C2 + (X3 - X2) * D
            Answer = X3 - 2 * Y3 / (S + sign( S ) * sqrt( S*S - 4.0 * Y3 * D ) )
            Y4 = Func( Answer )
           
            If ( Verbose )
                Output: I, Answer, Y4 with appropriate labels
            END

            If ( | Y4 | < Epsilon OR | Answer - X3 | < Epsilon )
                    Return
